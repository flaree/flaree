# Jamie (flare)

Hi, my name is Jamie, otherwise known as flare. I am currently in my final year of Computer Applications & Software Engineering in Dublin City University. My current interests mainly reside around Discord and integrating other features and automation of actions.

### Projects
I work on various projects in my spare time. These projects are mostly relating to Red-DiscordBot and my public bot [Pikachu](https://www.pikabot.xyz/ "Pikachu's Site"), which is built from the Red framework. I work on projects on the side, some of which include:

- flare-cogs - Various cogs for Red-DiscordBot
- pokecord-red - Pokecord rewrite for Red-DiscordBot
- r6statsapi - Asynchronous python wrapper for the R6Stats website.
