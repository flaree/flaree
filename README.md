# Jamie (flare)

Hi, my name is Jamie, otherwise known as flare. Computer Applications & Software Engineering graduate from Dublin City University. My current interests mainly reside around Discord and integrating other features and automation of actions.
### Projects
I work on various projects in my spare time, mainly surrounding Discord and bots. These projects are mostly relating to [Red-DiscordBot](https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot) and [Ballsdex](https://github.com/Ballsdex-Team/BallsDex-DiscordBot), a discord bot currently in over 250,000 servers. I work on projects on the side, some of which include:

- flare-cogs - Various cogs for Red-DiscordBot.
- pokecord-red - Pokecord rewrite for Red-DiscordBot.
- r6statsapi - Asynchronous python wrapper for the R6Stats website.
- lastfm-red - A last-fm cog for Red-DiscordBot.
- lastfm-charts/lastfm-backend - CHart visualization frontend + backend site for LastFM.
- dcuical - Generate an ICAL file of DCU course timetables, which can be integrated into applications such as Google Calendar.
